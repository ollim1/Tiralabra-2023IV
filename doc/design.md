# Design

The AI in this project will be implemented using the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm and any data structures it requires.

## Data structures

The Alpha-beta pruning variant of the Minimax algorithm will form an implicit tree that is explored only partially according to a heuristic.

## Input/Output

The application will use a textual representation of the chess board printed to standard output to visualize game state. Move input will consist of a pair of board coordinates; e.g. b2 e3.
